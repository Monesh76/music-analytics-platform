- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

### Infrastructure
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **Google Cloud**: Scalable cloud infrastructure
- **Local Development**: Python HTTP server for testing

## üéØ Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Recommendation Engine
- **Before**: Generic "Similar Track 1, Similar Track 2, Similar Track 3"
- **After**: Artist-specific, accurate recommendations
- **Examples**: 
  - Eagles ‚Üí ["Take It Easy", "Desperado", "One of These Nights", "Lyin' Eyes", "New Kid in Town"]
  - Queen ‚Üí ["We Will Rock You", "Another One Bites the Dust", "Somebody to Love", "Killer Queen", "Don't Stop Me Now"]

### 2. Realistic Analytics Confidence
- **Before**: Always 100% (unrealistic)
- **After**: Dynamic calculation based on data completeness (50%-95%)
- **Factors**: Track info, artist info, platform, famous artist bonus, complete metadata

### 3. Platform-Specific Track Selection
- **Before**: "Next Track" ignored selected platform
- **After**: "Next Track" respects the currently selected platform
- **How it works**: 
  - Select Spotify ‚Üí "Next Track" cycles through only Spotify tracks
  - Select Apple Music ‚Üí "Next Track" cycles through only Apple Music tracks
  - Select YouTube Music ‚Üí "Next Track" cycles through only YouTube Music tracks

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- **Backend API**: All platform tests passed successfully
- **Frontend**: Accessible and functional
- **Platform Selection**: Now properly updates radio buttons based on track platform
